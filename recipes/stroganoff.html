    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Brazilian Stroganoff is a delicious variant of a traditional beef stroganoff (usually made with noodles), that
        uses tomato paste and crema de leite, chicken, and is served on rice. Brazilian Stroganoff is often topped with
        shoestring potatoes, as all good Brazilian dishes are!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Chicken cut into cubes</li>
            <li>Diced onion</li>
            <li>Minced garlic</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>

            <li>White rice</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot or pan, start by heating the olive oil and cooking the diced onions and garlic until they
                are soft.</li>
            <li>Next, add the cubed chicken and cook through.</li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, start the rice in a separate pot, or use a rice cooker.</li>
            <li>Add the crema de leite and tomato paste, and mix with the chicken until it is a consistent mixture.</li>
            <li>Ensure the mixture is warmed through, and add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>To serve, add rice to the plate first, then add the stroganoff on top with a ladle. Top it off with some
                shoestring potatoes, and you're ready to go!</li>
        </ol>
